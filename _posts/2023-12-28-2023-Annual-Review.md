## Things I Failed / Regretted of doing
1. Follow the study plan: At the beginning of 2023, I wrote myself a study plan, including learning all the tools for data engineering, backend development, and some math things.
It ended up none of them were finished or being reached to a certein level. The way I learnt is going through the course and understnad how it works on high level.
But I soon gave up because I found out some of them are quite useless to me. I don't really have the chance to use them to solve a problem.
Instead of trying to learn specialic framework, maybe I should think of more problem / product I want to build and learn through building them.
