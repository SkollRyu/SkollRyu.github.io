## Things I Failed / Regretted of doing
1. **Failed to follow the study plan:** At the beginning of 2023, I created a study plan for myself, which included learning all the tools for data engineering, backend development, and some mathematical concepts. 
However, none of them were completed or reached a certain level. My learning approach involved going through the courses and understanding how they work at a high level.
Soon, I gave up because I discovered that some of the topics were quite useless to me, as I didn't have the opportunity to apply them to solve real-world problems. 
Instead of attempting to learn specialized frameworks, perhaps I should consider identifying specific problems or products I want to build and learn by actively working on them.

2. **Failed to manage my time effectively:** I realized that I spend a considerable amount of time doing nothing but using my phone (though I also use it for reading as well). Despite being awake for around 16 hours a day, allocating 4 hours for school and society, and dedicating 2-3 hours to my friends and family, my average screen time is still 6-7 hours per day. Calculating my free time as 16 - 4 - 3, I have approximately 9 hours of free time daily. Shockingly, I spend almost 2/3 of my free time glued to my phone, which is evidently not effective. Applying the 80/20 principle, I should be spending 12-13 hours on productive activities. It's clear that I need to work on improving my time management skills.

3. **Failed to deep dive into paper effectively:** Around in June, I started reading and discussing papers with a group of friends. Papers we read together are [Real-time Data Infrastructure at Uber](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00087.pdf) and [In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf). I managed to finish the paper with a brief understanding, which was not a good indicator. Firstly, picking a good paper that fits my interest/use case is very important. Secondly, figuring out the problem behind the solution is one of the key to understand the reason why this paper exist. Maybe I should read this one first, [How to Read Paper](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf)

4. **Regretted of spending too much time on coursework:** I usually get a pretty good grade for my coursework because I spent a good amount of time on them. At some point, I believed it's not neccessary to polish it again and again. The purpose of coursework was to allow student to apply the knowledge learnt from the module into practical coding. Once I could prove myself I understand what I have learnt by implementing the core task, it should be good to go. Instead of spending too much time on coursework, I should put these time on working on personal projects.
 
5. **Regretted of moving house:** Moved into a new house where the agencies and landlord are not responsible is kind of a nightmare. Dealing with the issues (Flooding, Mould, and other thing) just drained me of all energy. If I could make the choice again, I would either stay in a much smaller apartment or just pay more money to get a much confortable place. But this is a very good learning experience to understand the impact of decision and how to make decision in a systematic way. I learnt it from here [Reversible and Irreversible Decisions](https://fs.blog/reversible-irreversible-decisions/).
