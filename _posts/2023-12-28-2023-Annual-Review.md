## Things I Failed / Regretted of doing
1. **Failed to follow the study plan:** At the beginning of 2023, I created a study plan for myself, which included learning all the tools for data engineering, backend development, and some mathematical concepts. 
However, none of them were completed or reached a certain level. My learning approach involved going through the courses and understanding how they work at a high level.
Soon, I gave up because I discovered that some of the topics were quite useless to me, as I didn't have the opportunity to apply them to solve real-world problems. 
Instead of attempting to learn specialized frameworks, perhaps I should consider identifying specific problems or products I want to build and learn by actively working on them.

2. Failed to manage my time effectively: I realized that I spend a considerable amount of time doing nothing but using my phone (though I also use it for reading as well). Despite being awake for around 16 hours a day, allocating 4 hours for school and society, and dedicating 2-3 hours to my friends and family, my average screen time is still 6-7 hours per day. Calculating my free time as 16 - 4 - 3, I have approximately 9 hours of free time daily. Shockingly, I spend almost 2/3 of my free time glued to my phone, which is evidently not effective.

Applying the 80/20 principle, I should be spending 12-13 hours on productive activities. It's clear that I need to work on improving my time management skills.

3. **Failed to understand paper:** Around  in June, I started reading and discussing papers with a group of friends
